                            I lead and promote Machine and Deep Learning research and development within the Computational Omics and Systems Biology Group (CompOmics) of the Flemish Institute for Biotechnology (VIB). My research findings are currently being integrated into Bruker Corporation's commercial software to enhance the analysis of mass spectrometry data. Bruker, a global leader in scientific instruments and analytical solutions, is leveraging these advancements to improve the accuracy and efficiency of its analytical tools. In parallel I lead the development of a Software As A Service called ionbotTM (<a href="https://ionbot.cloud" target="_blank">https://ionbot.cloud</a>) funded by an Industrial Research Fund (IOF) grant of Ghent University. I'm currently involved in EU-funded projects BEXERNA and PROTrEIN.<br><br>
                            
                            As a Staff Scientist I also apply my expertise to advance AI-based data analysis for other groups with the VIB centre and the Ghent University Hospital. This includes the application of Large Language Models for protein analysis, plant gene regulation understanding and bacterial resistance prediction.
